# Welcome to my main 
aIn order to teach you about creating web pages,
this book is divided into three sections
the DNS servers that tell your
browser how to find the website.


Let's look closer at the code from the last page.
There are several different elements. Each
element has an opening tag and a closing tag


DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML 

Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer 
The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
X The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
X Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.



It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
X Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
X Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
X Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
X You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
X You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
